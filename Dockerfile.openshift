# From the upstream Dockerfile:
# At image build time, static files installed by efs-utils in the config directory, i.e. CAs file, need
# to be saved in another place so that the other stateful files created at runtime, i.e. private key for
# client certificate, in the same config directory can be persisted to host with a host path volume.
# Otherwise creating a host path volume for that directory will clean up everything inside at the first time.
# Those static files need to be copied back to the config directory when the driver starts up.
